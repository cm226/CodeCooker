2d grid of ocupied sections
2-way translation (ocupied section to list of elements(model ID?) and from modelIds to occupide section)

derrived classes below inherited ones. 
sibblings at same y position but translated X

insert new element:
	select empty space off size x, y boxes searching in x, y order diagnally outward

derrive from element
	find derrived element, translate all non siblings vertically 
	if can fit on sibling level withought interference from other structures then do so searching for space from left to right.if no space then translate all other elements right. 
	re position parent element above center of siblings

un-derriving an element will cause the reverse of the derrive from element opperation and the un-derrived element
to be placed in the codument as per the insert new element section.

layout engine will need to listen to arrows models

layout engine interface 
	PlaceElement(modelItemID)


placeElement PC
	add id to list of placed elememts
	consult arrows list for parent or children
	if any parent or children:

		if has parent only
			consult arrows for sibblings
			if has siblings
				find rightmost sibling
				if there is space at right most sibling
					put box in there
				else
					select height of sibbling and shift elements on the right right.
			else
				slect everything under sibling and move down
				put child directly inder sibling

		if has children only
			if space abouve children, put it there
			else select all children and shift down

		if it has parent and children, do both of aboue steps.

	else
		current box = boxes((0,0) , (n,n))

		diagnal = 1
		while space not found and not at edge
			
			for position in 0 .. diagnal
				currentbox.moveTo(position, diagnal)
				if currentbox.isEmpty()
					break
				currentbox.moveTo(diagnal, position)
				if currentbox.isEmpty()
					break
			
			diagnal++

		if currentBox.isEmpty()
			place element


layout grid

need to be able to group elements into structures so that they can be moved all togeather, a structure will have no gaps 
inside its bounds i.e the group will be one large block. the interface should have metheds where by lines of blocks can be 
selected and the contentce of those blocks and anything below them should be moved up/down for horizontal lines
of left/right for vertical lines. 

if there are any gaps between elements and are closed by a shift then the elements after the gaps will be pushed after
the gap has closed.

the layout grid will also need a query is empty method as well.
